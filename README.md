Many organismal traits are genetically determined and covary in evolving populations. The resulting trait correlations can either help or hinder evolvability – the ability to bring forth new and adaptive phenotypes. The evolution of evolvability requires that trait correlations themselves must be able to evolve, but we know little about this ability. To learn more about it, we here study two evolvable systems, a yellow fluorescent protein and the antibiotic resistance protein VIM2 metallo beta-lactamase.  We consider two traits in the fluorescent protein, namely the ability to emit yellow and green light, and three traits in our enzyme, namely the resistance against ampicillin, cefotaxime, and meropenem. We show that correlations between these traits can evolve rapidly through both mutation and selection on short evolutionary time scales. In addition, we show that these correlations are driven by a protein’s ability to fold, because single mutations that alter foldability can dramatically change trait correlations. Since foldability is important for most proteins and their traits, mutations affecting protein folding may alter trait correlations mediated by many other proteins. Thus, mutations that affect protein foldability may also help shape the correlations of complex traits that are affected by hundreds of proteins.
